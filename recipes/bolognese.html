                    <li>Peel and dice the garlic.</li>
                    <li>Dice your onion. Be sure sure to leave the root attached to avoid tears.</li>
                    <li>Put your pot on medium low heat, add the olive oil. Once it reached temp, add the onion and peppers. Cook for about 4-5 minutes when onions become milky translucent</li>
                    <li>Melt the butter in your sofrito, make sure the fire is below medium as you want to melt, not burn, the butter</li>

                    <li>Remove the sofrito from the pan, set aside. Add in your meats and be sure to crumble any large chunks with your wooden spoon. Cook for 8-10 minutes until meat is fully browned. Drain any extra fat</li>
                    <li>Add in the sofrito from above + your tomatoes. Smash the tomatoes into chunks while stirring.</li>
                    <li>Add in milk, chicken broth, and bay leafe</li>
                    <li>Leave on gentle simmer (barely bubbling) on low heat for about 3.5h while stirring. Season w/ salt and pepper to taste. Add in fresh chopped oregano</li>
