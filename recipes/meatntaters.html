                <b>Steps</b>
                <ol>                    
                    <li>Peel and dice your taters. Don't be religious about the peeling, a lil skin is good for ya</li>
                    <li>Bring a salted pot of water to boil</li>
                    <li>Add in your taters. Boil for about 18 mins or until taters are slipping off a fork. Once taters are done, save about a cup of the potato water (it's good, starchy stuff)</li>
                    <li>Mash taters w/ sour cream, butter. Add in splashes of the tater water and mix well until reaching your desired consistency. S+p to taste </li>
                    <li>Get a nice cut of beef</li>
                    <li>Don't fck up your nice cut of beef. Read seriouseats steak guide if newbie</li>
                    <li>Cook the green stuff. Oven roast with a lil olive oil, salt, and pepper your best bet.</li>
